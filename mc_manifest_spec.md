### CurseForge Resource Format
Under the hood, [mc-image-helper](https://github.com/itzg/mc-image-helper) is used to download files from CurseForge. As a result, the required format is the same as with the `mc-image-helper curseforge-files` command.

CurseForge projects (mods, resource packs, shader packs) can be specified with one of the following formats:
 - `<project ID>|<slug>:<file ID>`
 - `<project ID>|<slug>@<filename matcher>`
 - `<project ID>|<slug>`
 - Project page URL

Note that unless a specific version is requested, the latest applicable version is automatically selected.

### Modrinth Resource Format
Under the hood, [mc-image-helper](https://github.com/itzg/mc-image-helper) is used to download files from Modrinth. As a result, the required format is the same as with the `mc-image-helper modrinth` command.

Modrinth projects (mods, resource packs, shader packs) can be specified with one of the following formats:
 - `<project ID>|<slug>:<release type>`
 - `<project ID>|<slug>:<version name/number>`
 - `<project ID>|<slug>`

Note that `<release type>` can only be `release`, `beta`, or `alpha`. Unless a specific version is requested, the latest applicable version is automatically selected.
